#  How to run the multi-validateer docker setup

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have installed Docker with docker-compose. On Windows, this can be Docker Desktop with WSL 2 integration.

## Building the Docker containers

Run `docker-compose build` in this folder to build the worker image. This will build the worker from source and tag it in an image called `integritee-worker:dev`.

## Running the docker setup

`docker-compose up` will start all services (node and workers), using the `integritee-worker:dev` images you've built in the previous step.

## FAQ
### What do I have to do to stop everything properly?
With `Ctrl-C` you stop the containers and with `docker-compose down` you clean up/remove the containers. Note that `docker-compose down` will also remove any logs docker has saved, since it will remove all the container context.

### What do I have to do if I make changes to the code?
You need to re-build the worker image, using `docker-compose build`.

### How can I change the log level?
You can change the environment variable `RUST_LOG=` in the `docker-compose.yml` for each worker individually.

### The log from the node are quite a nuisance. Why are they all together.
You can suppress the log output for a container by setting the logging driver. This can be set to either `none` (completely disables all logs), or `local` (no console output, but docker will record the logs) in the `docker-compose.yml`:
```
logging:
    driver: local
```
Mind the indent. Explanations for all the logging drivers in `docker-compose` can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/).
