# substraTEE-worker
SubstraTEE worker for SubstraTEE node

This is part of [substraTEE](https://github.com/scs/substraTEE)

**Supports Rust nightly-2020-03-12**

## Intel SGX develoment and production (commercial) license
In order to perform a remote attestation of the enclave, an [Intel SGX Attestation Enhanced Service Privacy ID (EPID)](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/EPID-attestation) is needed. We use unlinkable quotes in our code.

### Development Access
Copy your SPID and key to the following files (use Linux line endings):
* `bin/spid.txt`: SPID of your subscription
* `bin/key.txt`: Key of your subscription (primary or secondary works)

The enclave will be signed with the development key found under `enclave/Enclave_privat.pem` and uses the configuration found under `enclave/Enclave.config.xml`.

### Production Access
Copy your SPID and key to the following files (use Linux line endings):
* `bin/spid_production.txt`: SPID of your subscription
* `bin/key_production.txt`: Key of your subscription (primary or secondary works)
These files are used to access the Intel Remote Attestation Service.

The enclave will be signed with the private key that was also registered and whitelisted at Intel's (in the process of obtaining a commercial license). Make sure that the key is exported as an environment variable called `SGX_COMMERCIAL_KEY`.

The enclave in production mode uses the configuration found under `enclave/Enclave.config.production.xml`.

## Private-tx demo
To run a demo for private tokens do the following:

Assumptions:
* your machine has SGX support
* Intel SGX SDK installed.
* rust toolchain is ready to build substrate

in terminal 1 run a substraTEE-node
```
git clone https://github.com/scs/substraTEE-node
cd substraTEE-node
git checkout tags/M5
cargo build --release
./target/release/substratee-node --dev --ws-port 9979 --rpc-port 9969
```

in terminal 2, run the worker
```
git clone https://github.com/scs/substraTEE-worker
cd substraTEE-worker
git checkout tags/M5
make
cd bin
RUST_LOG=info ./substratee-worker -p 9979 worker
```

in terminal 3, run the client
```
cd substraTEE-worker/bin
./substratee-client --node-ws-port 9979
```

Then you should see this in terminal 3:
```

### So, what happens here?

Alice wants to transfer 100k tokens privately to Bob. She doesn't use her substraTEE-node account for this as the transfer would be publicly visible.

Instead, she creates an *incognito* account and she keeps her account secret (also the public key). This account will never hit the substraTEE-node blockchain transparently.

The *Demo God* then gives Alice some initial Balance of 1M.

Bob also creates an *incognito* account and tells Alice (and only her) his public key.

Alice now uses SubstraTEE's *shielded transaction* feature to send 100k to Bob.

## Tests
### environment
Unit tests within the enclave can't be run by `cargo test`. All unit and integration tests can be run by the worker binary

first, you should run ipfs daemon because it is needed for testing
```
ipfs daemon
```
second, you'll need a substraTEE-node running
```
./target/release/substratee-node --dev --execution native
```
then you should make sure that the sealed_state is empty (but exists)
```
substraTEE-worker/bin$ rm sealed_stf_state.bin
substraTEE-worker/bin$ touch sealed_stf_state.bin
```

### execute tests
Run these with
```
substraTEE-worker/bin$ ./substratee-worker test_enclave --all
```
