# Sidechain Demo:
#
# Demonstrates that transfers happening on worker1 are communicated via sidechain blocks to worker2.
# It does essentially the same as `m8.sh`, but in one script and more streamlined.
#
# setup:
# run all on localhost:
#   integritee-node purge-chain --dev
#   integritee-node --tmp --dev -lruntime=debug
#   rm light_client_db.bin
#   export RUST_LOG=integritee_service=info,ita_stf=debug
#   integritee-service init_shard
#   integritee-service shielding-key
#   integritee-service signing-key
#   integritee-service run
#
# Then run this script.
#
# usage:
#  export RUST_LOG_LOG=integritee-cli=info,ita_stf=info
#  demo_sidechain.sh -p <NODEPORT> -A <WORKER_1_PORT> -B <WORKER_2_PORT> -m file
#
# TEST_BALANCE_RUN is either "first" or "second"
# if -m file is set, the mrenclave will be read from file.
