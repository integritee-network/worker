//! Some definitions and traits that facilitate interaction with the enclave.
//!
//! This serves as a proof of concept on how we could design the interface between the worker and
//! the enclave.
//!
//! Design principle here should be to keep the traits as slim as possible - because then the
//! worker can also define slim interfaces with less demanding trait bounds.
//!
//! This can further be simplified once https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/issues/254
//! is implemented. Then we can replace the several ffi::<enclave_call> and the boilerplate code
//! around it with a simple `fn ecall(call: CallEnum) -> Result<D: Decode>`, which wraps one single
//! ffi function.
